  "description": "An **integrally closed domain** $R$ is an #integral_domain whose integral closure in its field of fractions is $R$ itself. This means that if $x$ is an element of the field of fractions of $R$, i.e. a root of a monic polynomial with coefficients in $R$, then $x$ is itself an element of $R$.",
