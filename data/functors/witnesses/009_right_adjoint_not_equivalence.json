  "symbol": "",
  "definition": "The forgetful functor $U: \\mathbf{Grp} \\to \\mathbf{Set}$ from groups to sets has a left adjoint (the free group functor), making it a right adjoint. However, $U$ is neither full, nor faithful, nor essentially surjective, so it is not an equivalence.",
  "comments": "Most forgetful functors are adjoints but not equivalences."
