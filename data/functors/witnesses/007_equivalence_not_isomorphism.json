  "symbol": "",
  "definition": "Consider the category $\\mathbf{FinVect}_k$ of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field $k$, and let $C$ be the full subcategory consisting of just one representative from each isomorphism class (e.g., $k^n$ for each $n \\geq 0$). The inclusion functor $F: C \\to \\mathbf{FinVect}_k$ is fully faithful and essentially surjective, hence an equivalence. However, it is not surjective on objects, so it is not an isomorphism of categories.",
  "comments": "This is the canonical example showing that equivalence is weaker than isomorphism."
