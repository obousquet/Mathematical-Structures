  "definition": "The inclusion functor from the category of finite sets to the category of all sets is fully faithful and injective-on-objects (hence an embedding), but it is not surjective on objects, so it is not an isomorphism.",
  "comments": "Any non-surjective inclusion of a full subcategory provides such an example."
