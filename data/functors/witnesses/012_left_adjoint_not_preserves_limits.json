  "definition": "The tensor product functor $- \\otimes M: \\mathbf{Ab} \\to \\mathbf{Ab}$ for a fixed abelian group $M$ is a left adjoint (its right adjoint is $\\text{Hom}(M,-)$). However, tensor product does not preserve all limits. For example, it does not preserve infinite products in general.",
  "comments": "Left adjoints preserve colimits but generally do not preserve limits."
