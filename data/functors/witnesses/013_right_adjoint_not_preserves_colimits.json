  "definition": "The forgetful functor $U: \\mathbf{Grp} \\to \\mathbf{Set}$ is a right adjoint (its left adjoint is the free group functor). However, $U$ does not preserve all colimits. For example, it does not preserve coequalizers in general.",
  "comments": "Right adjoints preserve limits but generally do not preserve colimits."
