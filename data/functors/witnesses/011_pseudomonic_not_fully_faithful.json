  "definition": "Consider a functor $F$ that is conservative and essentially injective but not faithful. For example, the quotient map from a groupoid to its skeleton can be constructed to be pseudomonic without being fully faithful.",
  "comments": "Pseudomonic functors reflect isomorphisms and are essentially injective, but need not be fully faithful."
