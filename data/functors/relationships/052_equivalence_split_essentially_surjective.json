  "comments": "Proof: Let F: C -> D be an equivalence with quasi-inverse G: D -> C and natural isomorphisms η: 1_C ≅ GF and ε: FG ≅ 1_D. For any object Y in D, we have F(G(Y)) ≅ Y via ε_Y, and this isomorphism comes with a canonical inverse (ε_Y)^(-1) from the natural isomorphism structure. Thus F is split essentially surjective."
